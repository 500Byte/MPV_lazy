## Basic Instructions:
## There's no need to write parameters that are the same as the default values; they are shown here for demonstration.
## Lines starting with the "#" symbol are comments, meaning the option is not active (i.e., not read by mpv).
## Comment content explanation — # <optional values> [conditions required] Description of parameter meaning (additional notes)
## Some options are interrelated. MPV reads parameters from top to bottom, so pay attention to the order of general parameters. More explanations here: https://hooke007.github.io/unofficial/mpv_profiles.html#id4

## The following can be chosen to be enabled here, that is, by default, start every time with the player; or use the scheme in "input.conf" to manually choose to load

##⇘⇘ Script Part
## Built-in script switches (if there is no necessary purpose, then do not disable mpv's built-in functions)

load-auto-profiles = auto                   # <yes|no|default auto> New version of conditional configuration presets (users of the old version of the plugin remember to disable)
load-osd-console = yes                      # Console, default yes
load-stats-overlay = yes                    # Statistics information, default yes
osc = yes                                   # [Using some similar scripts preconditions (no)] Disable the original OSC (i.e., the built-in "osc.lua" script) to be compatible with third-party interface styles, default yes
ytdl = yes                                  # URL parsing enhancement, default yes
ytdl-raw-options-append =
                                            # [Valid when --ytdl=yes] Pass custom options to ytdl, default is empty https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#options
                                            # Example (cookies-from-browser=firefox) is only for passing a single option, multiple options are best appended independently, that is, write multiple --ytdl-raw-options-append parameters

load-scripts = yes                          # Automatically mount all external scripts in the /scripts/ directory, default yes. When set to no, you can use the next line example command to load the specified external script
scripts = "~~/scripts/xxxxx.lua;~~/scripts/yyyyy.lua"

##⇘⇘ Filter Part
## The format for setting audio/video filters to start with MPV (supports multiple items) --af/vf=filter①=parameter❶=value:parameter❷=value,filter②...
## --af and --vf can only exist one each. If you do not want to only use this parameter, you can split it up, for example, using --vf-append to append more filters multiple times, and it will not overwrite the filters specified by --vf
## For more practical filters, refer to https://github.com/hooke007/MPV_lazy/discussions/120

vf = vflip
vf-append = hflip
vf-append = format=rotate=90

##⇘⇘ Shader Part
## The --glsl-shaders here are used to specify shaders that start every time with MPV (supports multiple items). For specific shader information, see https://hooke007.github.io/unofficial/mpv_shaders.html
## --glsl-shaders-append is equivalent to --glsl-shader (note the difference in parameters from the line above), which means appending shaders (only one item can be appended at a time), and will not overwrite the first --glsl-shaders specified shader, you can infinitely append this command.

## Example writing method for initially loading multiple shaders
glsl-shaders = "~~/shaders/hooks_01.glsl;~~/shaders/hooks_02.glsl;~~/shaders/hooks_03.glsl"

## The subsequent individual --glsl-shaders-append (or --glsl-shader) will be arranged in order after --glsl-shaders, of course, you can also not write --glsl-shaders and only use the queue of the former two options
glsl-shaders-append = "~~/shaders/hooks_04.glsl"
glsl-shaders-append = "~~/shaders/hooks_05.glsl"

##⇘⇘ Color Management
## If you do not have a rich knowledge system in this field, it is not recommended to touch the contents here. If you just want to avoid the problem of oversaturation on wide color gamut screens without caring about color accuracy, you can try modifying --target-prim

icc-profile-auto = no # Automatic color calibration, default no
# If professional calibration has been done (system directory has the corresponding icm file), it should be enabled. For uncalibrated wide color gamut screens, it is recommended to manually specify --target-prim
icc-profile =
# This option is used to load a specified ICC, does not coexist with the previous item. The default is empty, for example, "X:/xxx/xxxx.icm"
icc-3dlut-size = auto # <2-512> Size of the 3D LUT generated from each dimension of the ICC configuration file. Default auto, usually, an example value like 64x64x64 is sufficient
icc-force-contrast = no # <default no|0-1000000|inf> Force specify the static contrast of ICC instead of using the built-in contrast of the configuration file (possible measurement errors)
# Ordinary LCD generally uses 1000 (based on the native panel data); OLED display users try using 1000000 or special value inf

target-prim = auto # [Not used with --icc-*] When ICC is not used, video colors will adapt to this color space
# For example, 99% of argb screens write adobe. 90%+ p3 color gamut screens write display-p3 (standard srgb screens do not need to change this default value)
target-trc = auto # [Not used with --icc-*] When ICC is not used, use the specified transfer characteristics. General monitors use the value gamma2.2

##⇘⇘ Audio and Video Synchronization Mode.

video-sync = audio # Default value audio (synchronized with audio/system clock) usually has the best compatibility but occasional frame drops and repeats
# When the value is display-resample, it has a similar "ReClock" effect, the video frames match the refresh rate (frame sampling), automatically adjusting the audio speed to compensate for the offset
video-sync-max-video-change = 1 # [Only effective when --video-sync=display-xxxx] Default 1
interpolation = no # [Only effective when --video-sync=display-xxxx] Reduces judder caused by mismatch between video frame rate and refresh rate. Default no
tscale = oversample # [Only effective when --interpolation=yes] Time interpolation algorithm (frame blending), the default effect is similar to MADVR's smoothmotion

##⇘⇘ "Quality" Related

cscale = # Chroma restoration algorithm. If not set, it will automatically use the value of --scale
scale = lanczos # Enlargement algorithm, default value lanczos (For the fastest algorithm, use bilinear)
dscale = hermite # Reduction algorithm. Default value hermite. If set to an empty value, it will automatically use the value of --scale
## All available built-in algorithms see the manual [06]

linear-upscaling = no # [Requires --fbo-format to specify 16-bit or higher precision; incompatible with --sigmoid-upscaling] (No effect on HDR content) default no
sigmoid-upscaling = yes # [Incompatible with --linear-upscaling] Non-linear color conversion when enlarging, can avoid strong ringing artifacts. Default yes
## Developers suggest either prioritizing --sigmoid-upscaling or simply not using either of the above two options
linear-downscaling = yes # [Requires --fbo-format to specify 16-bit or higher precision] (No effect on HDR content) default yes
## The above two --linear- parameters correspond to MADVR's "scale in linear light", linear processing when reducing size can improve the accuracy of color contrast
correct-downscaling = yes # [Invalid when --dscale=bilinear] Can be used to weaken the jagged edges generated by some algorithms when reducing size. Default yes
scaler-resizes-only = no # Whether to disable the scaler when no scaling is performed. Default no

dither-depth = auto # <N|no|default auto> Whether to enable color depth dithering to compensate for color conversion loss. The actual value of auto depends on --vo --gpu-context and may not be correct
# If you choose to fill in a specific value, it should generally match the bit depth set by the display driver
dither = fruit # <default fruit|ordered|error-diffusion|no> Algorithm for color depth dithering; value no is equivalent to --dither-depth=no
# Error diffusion is very good but unnecessary, it is based on compute shaders and requires not low performance overhead, weak perception
deband = no # Debanding, default no. May be affected by hardware decoding and actual effect

load-auto-profiles = auto # <yes|no|default auto> New version of conditional configuration presets (users of the old version of the plugin remember to disable)
load-osd-console = yes # Console, default yes

load-scripts = yes # Automatically mount all external scripts in the /scripts/ directory, default yes. When set to no, you can use the next line example command to load the specified external script
scripts = "~~/scripts/xxxxx.lua;~~/scripts/yyyyy.lua"

##⇘⇘ Filter Part
## The format for setting audio/video filters to start with MPV (supports multiple items) --af/vf=filter①=parameter❶=value:parameter❷=value,filter②...
## --af and --vf can only exist one each. If you do not want to only use this parameter, you can split it up, for example, using --vf-append to append more filters multiple times, and it will not overwrite the filters specified by --vf
## For more practical filters, refer to https://github.com/hooke007/MPV_lazy/discussions/120

vf = vflip
vf-append = hflip
vf-append = format=rotate=90

##⇘⇘ Shader Part
## The --glsl-shaders here are used to specify shaders that start every time with MPV (supports multiple items). For specific shader information, see https://hooke007.github.io/unofficial/mpv_shaders.html
## --glsl-shaders-append is equivalent to --glsl-shader (note the difference in parameters from the line above), which means appending shaders (only one item can be appended at a time), and will not overwrite the first --glsl-shaders specified shader, you can infinitely append this command.

## Example writing method for initially loading multiple shaders
glsl-shaders = "~~/shaders/hooks_01.glsl;~~/shaders/hooks_02.glsl;~~/shaders/hooks_03.glsl"

## The subsequent individual --glsl-shaders-append (or --glsl-shader) will be arranged in order after --glsl-shaders, of course, you can also not write --glsl-shaders and only use the queue of the former two options
glsl-shaders-append = "~~/shaders/hooks_04.glsl"
glsl-shaders-append = "~~/shaders/hooks_05.glsl"

##⇘⇘Simulating vsfilter related
##By default, there are some differences between libass and vsfilter rendered subtitles. The following options can be used to make the visual effects similar (imitating vsfilter)

sub-ass-vsfilter-aspect-compat = yes         # Stretch ASS subtitles when playing non-standard ratio videos, default yes
sub-ass-vsfilter-blur-compat   = yes         # Scale the "\blur" tag through video resolution instead of the resolution specified by .ass, default yes
sub-ass-vsfilter-color-compat  = basic       # <default basic|full|force-601|no> Subtitle color space processing

##⇘⇘Graphic subtitles —— IDX SUB SUP

stretch-image-subs-to-screen   = no          # Stretch graphic subtitles to scaled resolution instead of referring to video resolution, can make PGS achieve output on black edges effect, might distort display. Default no
image-subs-video-resolution    = no          # Use video resolution to override the original resolution of graphic subtitles, default no
