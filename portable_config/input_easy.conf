##⇘⇘This file only displays the binding syntax for regular shortcuts
##You can also use the option --input-conf in mpv.conf to specify this file as the default loaded shortcut settings file
##View the list of bound keys on the fourth page of the default setting (shift + i)

##⇘⇘Left to right are: Key value/Key name (required); Command triggered (required); Comments in Chinese (can be deleted)
##Note if --no-input-builtin-bindings parameter has already been used in the main settings file, it's unnecessary to apply "ignore" to keys you do not want to trigger
##The complete built-in mpv shortcut scheme can be found at https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf, all functions can be seen at https://mpv.io/manual/master/#input-conf

##Screenshot (frame by frame), execute the command again to stop. The default mode is the same as "s", you can add " video" or " window" after "each-frame" to modify the frame-by-frame screenshot method. You may need to use --framedrop=no in mpv.conf to avoid screenshot frame drops and repeats
